Steps before starting connection for Polhemus in Python
1. Open PDIMFC
2. Click on 'Connect', wait until device found is reported
3. Click on 'Continuous P&O' wait until continuous recordings are displaying on screen
4. Click on 'StartSockExport()'.
5. in powershell 3 perform command py .\C_TCP_Polhemus.py

To close connection go through steps in reversed order.

Overall order:
1) open up Git bash
2) run 'bash RunSimultExperiment.sh'
3) enter details for participant
4) First click the calibration button to run calibration procedure. when finished hit save
and quit.
5) To begin a trial start recording.
5) when finished with the trial shut the live plotting angle data, click save and quit on the GUI,
	and then shut the GUI window (this last process needs to be fixed! - instead save and quit
	should return back to step 3)

[ OUT OF DATE/ old method IGNORE!!:
In order to run both the angle_live_plots.py and EMG_live_plots.py files: 
	- open two powershells
	- move to the correct directory
	- in powershell 1 perform command py .\A_angle_live_plots.py
	- in powershell 2 perform command py .\B_UDP_Myo_broadcaster.py
To run with the Hololens applications:
	1) Run .py files
	2) Then run the app (.sln)
	3) Close angle_live_plots.py 
	4) Close EMG_live_plots.py ]
